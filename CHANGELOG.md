# NDC TypeScript SDK Changelog

## [6.1.0] - 2024-08-26
- Updated to support [v0.1.6 of the NDC Spec](https://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/specification/changelog.html#016) ([#37](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sdk-typescript/pull/37))
  - Support for [querying nested collections](https://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/specification/queries/filtering.html#nested-collections) inside an EXISTS expression in a predicate

## [6.0.0] - 2024-08-08
Breaking changes ([#36](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sdk-typescript/pull/36)):
- `Connector.healthCheck` has been removed and replaced with `Connector.getHealthReadiness`, which only returns whether the connector is able to accept requests, not whether any underlying connections to data sources actually work.
- The `/health` endpoint is now unauthorized, allowing healthchecks to be performed without authorization.
- `Connector.getCapabilities` now returns `Capabilities` instead of `CapabilitiesResponse`. The SDK will now take care of adding the correct NDC version to the `Capabilities` on behalf of the connector.

## [5.2.0] - 2024-07-30
- The connector now listens on both ipv4 and ipv6 interfaces by default. This can be configured by using the `HASURA_CONNECTOR_HOST` environment variable, which sets the host the web server listens on. ([#34](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sdk-typescript/pull/34))
- Updated to support [v0.1.5 of the NDC Spec](https://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/specification/changelog.html#015) ([#35](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sdk-typescript/pull/35))
  - There are no real changes in this version; it is a version number-only change

## [5.1.0] - 2024-06-19
- Updated to support [v0.1.4 of the NDC Spec](https://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/specification/changelog.html#014) ([#33](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sdk-typescript/pull/33))
  - Support for [aggregates](https://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/specification/queries/aggregates.html) over nested fields

## [5.0.0] - 2024-05-31

  - Breaking change: new `nested_fields` property on `QueryCapabilities`; set it to `{}` to retain previous v0.1.2 semantics and not support new v0.1.3 capabilities.

  - Command line arguments `--otlp-endpoint` and `--service-name` have been removed in favour of the environment variables
  - Import `@hasura/ndc-sdk-typescript/instrumentation` to use `initTelemetry` to initialize OpenTelemetry earlier in your startup, if necessary

- Add OpenTelemetry support
  - Set env var `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` to the endpoint to send OpenTelemetry to

  - The `RawConfiguration` type parameter has been removed
- The default port has changed from 8100 to 8080
- The command line arguments passed to the `serve` command have changed:
  - The `--configuration` argument now takes the connector's configuration directory. Its associated environment variable is now `HASURA_CONFIGURATION_DIRECTORY`
  - The `--otlp_endpoint` argument has been renamed to `--otlp-endpoint` and its environment variable is now `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`

## [3.0.0] - 2024-02-13
Breaking change: support for the [v0.1.0-rc.15 of NDC Spec](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-spec/compare/v0.1.0-rc.14...v0.1.0-rc.15).

- The [mutation request/response format has changed](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-spec/pull/90).
  - `MutationOperation` fields are now defined as a `NestedField`
  - `MutationOperationResponse` now returns a single value rather than a rowset

## [2.0.0] - 2024-02-05
Breaking change: support for the [v0.1.0-rc.14 of NDC Spec](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-spec/compare/v0.1.0-rc.13...v0.1.0-rc.14).

- Function name formatting is now standard JavaScript `camelCase`. NDC types used for wire-transmission match the spec (snake_cased).
- Added [nested field selections](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-spec/pull/70) (`Field.fields`)
- Capabilities now only specifies [a single supported version](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-spec/pull/82) (`CapabilitiesResponse.version`)
- `Expression.where` [renamed](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-spec/pull/87) to `Expression.predicate`
- `PathElement.predicate` is now [optional](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-spec/pull/87)
- Added [Predicate types](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-spec/blob/main/rfcs/0002-boolean-expression-types.md) (new `predicate` Type.type)

- Comparison operators
- [Changes to explain](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-spec/pull/85):
  - `Connector.explain` renamed to `Connector.queryExplain` and endpoint moved from `/explain` to `/query/explain`.
  - `Connector.mutationExplain` added with endpoint `/mutation/explain`.
  - `explain` capability moved to `query.explain`. `mutation.explain` capability added.
- `ComparisonOperatorDefinition` now has `equal` and `in` as [two standard definitions](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-spec/pull/79/files) and custom operators can be defined. The equality operator is no longer required to be defined and must be explicitly defined.

## [1.2.8] - 2024-01-18
- Add new `ConnectorError` types:
  - `UnprocessableContent`: The request could not be handled because, while the request was well-formed, it was not semantically correct. For example, a value for a custom scalar type was provided, but with an incorrect type
  - `BadGateway`: The request could not be handled because an upstream service was unavailable or returned an unexpected response, e.g., a connection to a database server failed
- Generate TypeScript declaration maps for better "go to definition" tooling

## [1.2.7] - 2023-12-21
- `get_serve_command` and `get_serve_configuration_command` now support creation without
  automatically starting servers. This allows usage in scenarios where a customized server startup
  is desired.

- added auth hook using secret token
